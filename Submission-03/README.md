CREATE A TEST PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x.  What is a test plan?
    
    "Before any piece of software or new feature goes out to your users, you need to thoroughly put it through its paces. Test it. Try to break it. And make sure that whatever your users do, it responds as designed." - 5 Steps

x.  Introduction                Highlight test plan objectives, high-level scope, and schedule. 
x.  Test Scope                  What tests are you going to undertake?
                                Why have you chosen these ones (and not others)?
x.  Test Strategy               What rules will your tests follow?
                                What metrics are you going to collect at what level?
                                How many different configurations or environments are you going to test?
                                Are there any special requirements or procedures you need to test?
                                What are the pass/fail criteria for each test?
x.  Exit Criteria               When is a feature considered "successful"?
x.  Suspension Criteria         When should you pause a test?
x.  Resumption Requirements     When should you resume a paused test?
x.  Assumptions & Risks
x.  Resource Needs & Schedule
x.  Test Deliverables & Roles and Responsiblities

The 5 Steps:
1.  Analyze the product you're testing.

        x. learn about scope, objectives and functionality of the project
        x. review documentation
        x. perform a product walkthrough to understand functionality, user flow, and limitations

This step will be described in your test plan introduction and objectives. 
    
2.  Design the test strategies (and approach) you plan to use.
        x. Customer Requirement     What are your users going to use most?
        x. Budget and Timeline      How much time & resources do you have to complete testing?
        x. Product Specs            What are the most important features that need to be tested?
        x. Team Abilities           Do you have the technical expertise necessary to perform the tests?

    Commonly used testing approaches: 
        x. Unit             Test the smallest piece of software or a specific feature.
        x. API              Test the API created for the application in multiple scenarios. 
        x. Integration      Test multiple software modules or features as a group. 
        x. System           Test the entire integrated system against its requirements. 
        x. Install          Test the install/uninstall process your customers will go through. 
        x. Compatability    Test your software performance on different hardware, OS & environments.
        x. Load & Stress    Test your software performance as the workload increases beyond typical. 

Deciding what to test and documenting your test strategy are the most critical parts of your test plan. 

3.  Define the test objectives and pass/fail criteria.

    For example, if you were doing a performance test you might look at metrics such as: 
        x. Response Time                Total time to send a request and get a response. 
        x. Wait Time                    How long it takes to receive the first byte after a request is sent. 
        x. Average Load Time            Average amount of time it takes to deliver every request. 
        x. Peak Response Time           The longest amount of time it takes to fulfill a request. 
        x. Requrest Per Second          How many requests can be handled.
        x. Transactions Passed/Failed   Total number of succesful/unsuccesful requests. 
        x. Memory Utilization           How much memory is needed to process the request. 

Decide what is "good enough" to get your software out and in the hands of users. 

4.  Plan the test environment.

As part of your scope, you need to decide what hardware, software, OS, and device combinations you're going to be testing. 

This is a situation where it pays to be specific. 

5.  Execute the test plan and track progress in your project management tool.

Once your test plan is in place, there is a specific process you need to follow. Think of this as the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). Similar to the Software Development Life Cycle, The STLC follows each phase of testing and usually looks something like this: 

    x. Requirements/Design Review
    x. Test Planning
    x. Test Designing
    x. Test Environment Setup
    x. Test Execution
    x. Test Reporting


INCLUDE TEST CASES FROM PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS IN TEST PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does not apply to my IP01 submission. 
Instead of actually checking out, modifying code on MySimpleCalculator, checkin it back it, etc., etc..
I simply made adjustments within the project that were visible and substantial in proving Github collaborative abilities.
