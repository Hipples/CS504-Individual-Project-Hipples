Each student will conduct a requirements engineering process and map the resulting requirements into a systems architecture or high-level design. The student will trace the mapping of requirements to modules in the architecture.

The student will choose an architectural style based on the appropriateness of the style to the requirements. Based on the style the student will complete the architecture/high level design to the level where it is ready for implementation.

The student will create all design artifacts appropriate to the selected style.
