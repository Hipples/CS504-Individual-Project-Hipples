IP01 Instructions

Requirements & Deliverables:
x. Please use GitHub and Git as the CMS system.
x. You'll need to create two accounts in the system, including one with applicable admin rights (Hipples & swiseWHAT).
x. You'll need to create written test cases including process flows, where applicable, and demonstrate their functionality in       
   Github for the following:
        x. Code check out
        x. Code check in
        x. Code snapshot (or release point)
        x. Code in development by two users:
            x. First user/account checks out the code
            x. Second dev/user/account checks out the code and makes changes
            x. The first dev/user/account then makes their change and needs to check it in
                     
                     x. QUESTION: How would you ensure you are including everyone's changing without overwriting anything?            
                     x. ANSWER: git pull is required prior to git push origin main if the repository has been updated by another user at any point                     
        
        x. Code changes rolled back to a previous level
        x. One dev/user/account is working on a new version while one is fixing bugs in a previous release.

Your final deliverable should document the written test cases, any process flows, screenshots of each step in the process and the final end result.  Please include any corresponding narrative to support your thought process and remember to cite your sources.
